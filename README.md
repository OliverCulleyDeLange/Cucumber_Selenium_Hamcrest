Cucumber_Selenium_Hamcrest
==========================

A project demonstrating the capabilities of Cucumber BDD testing coupled with Selenium Web Drivers and Hamcrest Matchers

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The idea of this mini project is to work on a nice way of working with Cucumber and Selenium.

The idea of sharing a Browser instance or a pool or Browsers that we can dip into is nice, and at somepoint I will make this thread safe so we can have tests running on seperate threads concurrently. 

Imagine, approx 4 browsers on your screen dancing away in perfect harmony running your tests at lightning speed.

Cucumber is also featured - see what i did there? ;) 
I wanted to find a nice way to share the Selenium browsers between cucumber tests. Do the set up and tear down nicely too.

Hamcrest is included as I need to learn about it. I imagine it's currently not very well implemented.
